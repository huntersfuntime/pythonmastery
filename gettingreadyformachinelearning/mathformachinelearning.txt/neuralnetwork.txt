Neural Network
Complex classification


Use cases.

Self driving cars:

Complex reccommendation engines:

Image recognition:
(when you want)
Not only need to classify hand writing but need to process hand writing in many different languages. 

Natural language processing (NLP):
Alexa, Google Home, etc.

Whenever you ask siri what the weather in your hometown is, it uses nlp. But it gets routed through a network that processes your speach patterns, rip apart the words you say, guess your intention, make a prediction, then give a reccomendation.

Pros

- Incredibly Powerful: 

- Simple to implement*
but not always simple to implement the right way.

Tensor flow is one most popular out there. Does not require much work on your side. 

Cons

- Resource intensive: 

needs to run on outside systems. Need to have a entire network of servers that are all connected. Can't typically run it on a single computer or server. Usually require a GPU not CPU.

Very expensive for hardware.

- Black Box:

Leaves you a little blind to understanding how something is occuring, because it doesn't give the the factor tree that shows you why it made the decisions it did.



- Slow performance:
