Allows you to generate a probability between two potential outcomes.

You really focus on the two potential outcomes.

Category: regression and classification

Dichotomous variable: Can only have a maximum of two outcomes.

Use cases:

- Image classification
- Medical diagnosis
- Political predictions
- Sales predictions
- Component inside of a neural net

So for example in a neural network if they think a letter is either an I or an L linear regression is a great component to determine what it is.

Pros:
-Very fast
-Inutuitive predictions
-Can be integrated into nerual networks

Cons:
-Requires many pre-processing tasks
-More complex math


Case Study:
Predicting cancer in medical patients

White blood cell count. 
THere are only two different statuses we are looking at.
cancer, or not_cancer.

These tend to like working with numberic values, so 0 or 1.

Run function for prediction.

Uses sigroid function.
Creates a curved line instead of a straight line. Then allows you to place the datapoint in a much more accurate value.
