Still a function.
A tool that allows you to wrap up a function, usually a smaller function, and easily pass it to another function.

Wrap up some small behavior and pass it to other functions.

full_name = lambda first, last: f'{first} {last}'

print(full_name('Hunter', 'Orges'))

def greeting(name):
  print(f'Hi there {name}')


greting(full_name('Hunter', 'Orges'))
