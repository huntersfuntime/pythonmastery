To define a variable like ruby it is 

name = "Hunter"
post_count = 42

variables are snake case like above
never name a variable like this
PostCount because it is how something else is named.

Pep8 is the official style guide for python code.

simple variables like
x and y are bad naming conventions..

better example would be

num_one
num_two

Creator of rails keeps a thesaraus for naming conventions
