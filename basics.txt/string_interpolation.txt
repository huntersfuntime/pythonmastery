How to Use Python's format method to Implement Index Based String Interpolation # 1362

Does not use this much anymore. But be aware of it and what it does.


name = 'Kristine'
age = 12
product = 'Python eLearning course'
from_account = 'Jordan'

greeting = "Product Purchase: {2} - Hi {0}, you are listed as {1} years old. - {3}".format(name, age, product, 'Jordan')

greeting = f"Product Purchase: {product} - Hi {name}, you are listed as {age} years old. - {from_account}"

print(greeting)

QUERY IN A STRING>

.index can break your whole site if it turns false. Because it throws the error. That is why you use in. 


sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'

query = sentence.find('oops')
query_two = sentence.index('oops')

print(query)
print(query_two)

query = 'oops' in sentence

print(query)

When a string is immutable, this is what you will use to replace.



sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'

sentence = sentence.replace('quick', 'slow')

print(sentence.replace('quick', 'slow'))
print(sentence)
