Can store each data type in a variable.

Lists are similar to an array.

Dictionaries are like hashes.



meal_completed = True
meal_completed = False (they use capitalize)

sub_total = 100
tip = sub_total * 0.2
print(sub_total)
total = sub_total + tip
print(total)
receipt = "Your total is " + str(total)
print(receipt)
