Introduction to the Numpy Package in Python # 1507

import numpy as np

num_range = np.arange(16)

num_range

# array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])

num_range.reshape(4, 4)

# array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14, 15]])


Go over documentation for better understanding. This is used a lot in data science.

Makes a list than slices it into its own lists.
