Functions in a class are called methods

class Student:

student = Student()           Creating an instance of a class 

mark = Student("Hunter")       special methods are only available in classes (constructor method is one)

self method. refers to the instance of the class.

__init__ constructor method


def __str__(self):
    return "Student". will override method in object.

Class attributes or setters are not defined to self or instance they are static.

print(Student.school_name)



Inheritance and polymorphism. Tying things together.
So inheriting the behavior of the student class but create a new class from it called high school student.

super() method

import on files.


Instance attributes in classes become dictionaries automatically
